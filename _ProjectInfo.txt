ASTRUX
-------
A live-oriented setup creation tool, for a complete show control
Linux based, using FLOSS only

Setup :
1)astrux scans the computer for audio/midi capabilities
2)the user builds a project
	- analog/digital audio inputs/outputs based on computer capabilities
	- audio and midi players (synchronized backing tracks)
	- configurable metronome track
	- sampler instruments
3)astrux is generating the audio/midi configurations and offers unified/standardized control over TCP/OSC/MIDI

Use:
1) start saved project
2) now play !


All audio/midi parameters are accessible trough OSC (standard) and MIDI (if needed). A generated file is available as a reference.

Each audio output bus has independant controls, allowing personal monitoring mixes, and in-the-box foh mixing (individual inputs can also be routed to single hardware outputs for out-the-box mixing)
 
The whole astrux tool can be configured from the command-line without any GUI. It is based on standard INI files and a few scripts. A setup mode GUI exists as a frontend, generating the same necessary configuration files.

Also a live GUI exists for a user-friendly experience, but any OSC/MIDI/TCP remote can be used if the correct messages are passed/handled to/from astrux.

Audio players are based on ecasound. When a project containing multiple players on songs is started, ecasound will load all songs chainsetups in the background, but connect only one will be connected at a time. this allow for fast context switching from one song to another.

You can define replacement tracks to feed a strip with pre-recorded material. Just in case some real human is not here to do the job.

OPTIONS
--------
 - rehersal mode
	audio channel strips are editable (will restart mixers)
	midi filters/patch are editable (will restart midi bridge)
	players remain active after the end, so you can rewind to any position
 - live mode
 	players are stopped once reaching the end
	fallback to a defined inter-song state possible
 - preload all sampler instruments on startup
