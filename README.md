ASTRUX

A setup creation tool for live-oriented musicians
======
(under active development by RaphaÃ«l Mouneyres)

some features : 
  expandable audio mixer with channel strips, effects, submixes ... 
  personal monitoring buses with automatic touchosc presets generation
  support for external effects loop
  configurable midi patch with routing and filters
  audio/midi backing tracks
  save mixer states for each song (including personal monitoring mixes)
  ...etc

Linux based, using FLOSS only
  Audio engines : non-mixer, ecasound
  Midi engines : mididings, jpmidi, smfplayer
  Sampler engine : linuxsampler
  supported communication protocols : MIDI, OSC, TCP socket

To correctly build a project, you have to follow some rules :
- you follow the project folder structure
- you have correctly formatted INI files
- you have at least a project.ini file in the project folder
- you define audio mixers, with at least a 'main' mixer
- in each mixer, you define channels
- for each song you have a song.ini file

many error checks are done so the script will most probably die on missing or bad info.

Quick use
======
To generate files, cd into the project base folder and do : 
perl /pathto/generate.pl

To start the project, cd into the project base folder and do : 
perl /pathto/modules/Live.pl myproject.cfg

More info
======
All audio/midi parameters are accessible trough OSC and MIDI. A generated file is available as a reference.

Each audio output bus has independant controls, allowing personal monitoring mixes, and in-the-box foh mixing (individual inputs can also be routed to single hardware outputs for out-the-box mixing)
 
The whole astrux tool can be configured from the command-line without any GUI. It is based on standard INI files and a few scripts.A setup mode GUI exists as a frontend, generating the same necessary configuration files.

Also a live GUI exists for a user-friendly experience, but any OSC/MIDI/TCP remote can be used if the correct messages are passed/handled to/from astrux.

Audio players are based on ecasound. When a project containing multiple players on songs is started, ecasound will load all songs chainsetups in the background, but connect only one will be connected at a time. this allow for fast context switching from one song to another.

You can define replacement tracks to feed a strip with pre-recorded material. Just in case some real human is not here to do the job.

Goals
======

Setup :
1)astrux scans the computer for audio/midi capabilities
2)the user builds a project
  - add analog/digital audio inputs/outputs based on computer capabilities
  - add audio and midi players (synchronized backing tracks)
  - add metronome track
  - add sampler instruments
3)astrux is generating the audio/midi configurations and offers unified/standardized control over TCP/OSC/MIDI

Use:
1) start saved project
2) now play !

OPTIONS
--------
 - rehersal mode
  audio channel strips are editable (will restart mixers)
  midi filters/patch are editable (will restart midi bridge)
  players remain active after the end, so you can rewind to any position
 - live mode
  players are stopped once reaching the end
  fallback to a defined inter-song state possible
 - preload all sampler instruments on startup
