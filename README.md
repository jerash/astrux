#ASTRUX

A setup creation tool for live-oriented musicians
(under active development by RaphaÃ«l Mouneyres)

##Features
- expandable audio mixer with channel strips, effects, submixes ... 
- personal monitoring buses with automatic touchosc presets generation
- support for external effects loop
- configurable midi patch with routing and filters
- audio/midi backing tracks
- save mixer states for each song (including personal monitoring mixes)
- ...etc

Linux based, using FLOSS only

- Audio engines : non-mixer, ecasound
- Midi engines : mididings, jpmidi, smfplayer
- Sampler engine : linuxsampler
- supported communication protocols : MIDI, OSC, TCP socket

All audio/midi parameters are accessible trough OSC, MIDI and TCP commands. Memo files are available as a reference to accessible parameters after project generation.

Each audio output bus has independent controls, allowing personal monitoring mixes, and in-the-box foh mixing (individual inputs can also be routed to single hardware outputs for out-of-the-box mixing)
 
The whole astrux tool can be configured from the command-line without any GUI. It is based on standard INI files and a few scripts. A setup mode GUI exists as a frontend, generating the same necessary configuration files.

Also a live GUI exists for a user-friendly experience, but any OSC/MIDI/TCP remote can be used if the correct messages are passed/handled to/from astrux.

Audio players are based on ecasound. When a project containing multiple players on songs is started, ecasound will load all songs chainsetups in the background, but connect only one will be connected at a time. this allow for fast context switching from one song to another.

You can define replacement tracks to feed a strip with pre-recorded material. Just in case some real human is not here to do the job.

##Goals
###SETUP
- astrux scans the computer for audio/midi capabilities
- the user builds a project
- add analog/digital audio inputs/outputs based on computer capabilities
- add audio and midi players (synchronized backing tracks)
- add metronome track
- add sampler instruments
- astrux is generating the audio/midi configurations and offers unified/standardized control over TCP/OSC/MIDI

###USE
- start the saved project
- now play !

###Rehersal mode
- audio channel strips are editable (will restart mixers, audio gap inevitable)
- midi filters/patch are editable (will transparently restart midi bridge)
- players remain active after the end, so you can rewind to any position
###Live mode
- players are stopped once reaching the end of a song
- automaic fallback to a defined inter-song state possible
- preload all sampler instruments on startup

##Milestones

###V0.1 (12/02/2014)
- INPUTS mixer : strips with volume,eq,auxsends
- PLAYERS : with ecasound
- MIXERS : with ecasound or non-mixer

###V0.2 (currently running)
- MIDI/OSC/TCP bridge live control
- optionally generated touchosc presets
- Metronome : klick with timebase master mode and jack control
- SAMPLER : drums
- MIDI : jpmidi v0.35 player

###V0.3
- web frontend for inifiles generation
- midi patchbay editor
- video player (xjadeo)
- replacement tracks
- tracks meters in osc server

###V0.4
- automate fx rack / plugin host
- realtime cpu/memory check (trigger alarms)
- preloading the next song is possible, for faster context switching
- dmx player (with jack synchro), probably using midi with http://qlc.sourceforge.net/index.shtml, or OSC .... https://github.com/mcallegari/qlcplus

###V0.5
- midi editor (midish with jack synchro)
- audio editor (nama)
- live cd/usb distribution creation

##Quick use
To correctly build a project, you have to follow some rules :
- you follow the project folder structure
- you have correctly formatted INI files
- you have at least a project.ini file in the project folder
- you define audio mixers, with at least a 'main' mixer
- in each mixer, you define channels
- for each song you have a song.ini file

To generate files, cd into the project base folder and do : 
perl /pathto/generate.pl

To start the project, cd into the project base folder and do : 
perl /pathto/modules/Live.pl myproject.cfg

many error checks are done so the script will most probably die on missing or bad info.
